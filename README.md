NOTE
----

This project has been abandoned as of now. We now have a morally
equivalent project in Coq. See https://github.com/raaz-crypto/verse-coq

Verse
-----

Verse is a DSL for writing assembly language code in agda. Verse is
designed specifically to write portable assembly language code for
implementing cryptographic primitives for the Raaz cryptographic
library. Therefore it provides a rather limited set of features and
might not be suitable for other purposes.


Requirements
------------

Agda 2.4.2.2
Agda-stdlib 0.9
